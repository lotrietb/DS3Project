{"name":"Hospital Appointment System","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Doctor Manager System.\r\nFor this project we chose a simple hospital appointment management system. The system connects to a centralized Oracle database, and is used by the receptionist to capture appointment details. The doctor can then access the same system to see his appointments for the day, if any. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd lotrietb/ds3\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Members\r\nWe are two students Brandon Lotriet and Clive-Marcus Evertse at The Cape Peninsula University of Technology.
